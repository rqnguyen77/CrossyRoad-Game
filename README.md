# CPSC-386-Final-Project-CrossyRoad

Due Date: May 23rd, 2021

Group: Randy Nguyen randyxnguyen77@csu.fullerton.edu

Download "Contents.zip" for the full project.

Recreate the classic Crossy Road game, using the Unreal 4 Engine, assets
created using a Voxel editor such as MagicaVoxel, and code written either in C++ (written to interface
with Blueprints and the Unreal framework), or with Blueprints, or both.
The 3d assets you will need will all have to be created using an Voxel editor such as MagicaVoxel, or
from other 3d asset sources from Unreal. The audio resources you will need can be captured using an
audio editor such as Audacity from Crossy Road running on a laptop or desktop computer, or running
as an iOS or Google app on a mobile phone.

# Issues:
1. Restart Button and Paused widets not working properly. (Won't unpause when paused and won't restart on button press)
2. Score is not displaying for the used when playing.
3. Lilypads not aligned with chicken to actually jump on sometimes.
4. Chicken does not move with log when chicken jumps on it. (Can still move on log and jump following the log)
5. There are currently no trains or railtracks on the world/level.
