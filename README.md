Download "Contents.zip" for the full project.

Recreated the classic CrossyRoad game, using the Unreal 4 Engine, assets
created using a Voxel editor with MagicaVoxel, and code written either in C++ (written to interface
with Blueprints and the Unreal framework), or with Blueprints, or both.

# Issues:
1. Restart Button and Paused widets not working properly. (Won't unpause when paused and won't restart on button press)
2. Score is not displaying for the used when playing.
3. Lilypads not aligned with chicken to actually jump on sometimes.
4. Chicken does not move with log when chicken jumps on it. (Can still move on log and jump following the log)
5. There are currently no trains or railtracks on the world/level.
